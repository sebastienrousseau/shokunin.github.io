## Welcome to Shokunin

We are delighted that you have decided to try Shokunin, and are sure that you
will find that Shokunin Static Site Generator (SSG) is unique.

The Shokunin Installation Guide provides step-by-step instructions for
installing and using Shokunin. It includes details about prerequisites,
supported platforms, installation, basic usage, and examples.

## System Requirements

This section contains information about what hardware you need to get started
with Shokunin. It also lists the operating systems that Shokunin supports.

### Supported Hardware

You can install Shokunin on macOS, Linux, Windows, BSD, and on any machine that
can run Rust and Cargo. Shokunin is a command-line tool that you install on
your local system. It is not a web application that you run on a web server.

## Before Installing Shokunin

This chapter deals with the preparation for installing Shokunin. This includes
backing up your data, and installing the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

To build Shokunin from source, you will need to have
[Git â§‰](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git"),
[Rust â§‰](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install "Rust") and
[Cargo â§‰](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo "Cargo") installed.

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust `1.70.0` or
later (stable). It is recommended that you install the latest stable version of
Rust.

### Platform support

Shokunin is supported and tested on the following platforms:

### Installing Shokunin Static Site Generator

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install Shokunin using the following command in your terminal:

```
cargo install ssg
```

For simplicity, we have given Shokunin a simple alias `ssg` which can stand for `Shokunin Site Generator` or `Static Site Generator`.

## Build Shokunin from source

To build from source, use the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/shokunin.git
cd shokunin
cargo install --path .
ssg --version
```

This will clone the repository, build the binary and install it in your Cargo bin directory.

## Usage

Shokunin is a command-line tool. You can see the available commands by entering:

```
ssg --help
```

## Creating a New Site

Run:

```
ssg  --new=mysite --content=content --template=template --output=output --serve=public
```

or

```
ssg  -n=mysite -c=content -t=template -o=output -s=public
```


This command will create a new website with the name `mysite` in the current directory. It will use the `content` directory to gather the website content and the `template` directory to generate the website files. It will serve the website directly from the `mysite` directory.

### Arguments

- `-n`, `--new`: The name of the new website. (required)
- `-c`, `--content`: The directory containing the website content. (required)
- `-t`, `--template`: The directory containing the website templates. (required)
- `-o`, `--output`: The directory where the generated website files will be saved temporarily. (required)
- `-s`, `--serve`: Run the development server. (optional). The directory from which the website will be served.

### In your project

To use the Shokunin library in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
ssg = "0.0.14"
```

Add the following to your `main.rs` file:

```
extern crate ssg;
use ssg::*;
```

then you can use the Shokunin functions in your application code.

### Examples

Explore the examples directory of the project to get started with Shokunin. To run an example, clone the repository and run the following command from the project root directory:

```
cargo run --example example
```

The command will generate a static website based on the configuration details in the `examples` directory.

```
use ssg::compiler::compile;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Define the paths to the build, site, source and template directories.
    let build_path = Path::new("examples/example.com/build");
    let site_path = Path::new("examples/example.com/public");
    let content_path = Path::new("examples/example.com/contents");
    let template_path = Path::new("examples/example.com/templates");

    compile(build_path, content_path, site_path, template_path)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

The main() function in this code compiles a website from the `content` directory, using the `template` directory to generate the website files. The compiled website is saved in the `build` directory and served directly from the `example.com` directory.

#### Args

- `build_path:` The path to the directory where the compiled website will be saved.
- `content_path:` The path to the directory containing the website content.
- `site_path:` The path to the directory where the generated website files will be served from.
- `template_path:` The path to the directory containing the website templates.
