## 4 easy steps to build a website with Shokunin

Let's learn how to build a website with the Shokunin Static Site Generator (SSG) in 4 easy steps:

### 1. Download the Kaishi starter template

First let's download [Kaishi][01], a simple starter template based on
[Bootstrap â§‰][04]. This guide will show you how to set up Kaishi, from creating
a website to deployment on your server.

Download the Kaishi Starter Template from our [website â§‰][02] or directly via
[Github â§‰][03].

### 2. Unzip the package

Unzip the package and rename the `kaishi` folder to your project name.

```shell
unzip kaishi.zip
mv kaishi mysite
```

#### Understanding the Kaishi folder directory

The Kaishi Starter Template is organised in a way that allows for simple content
management and website organisation. It has the following folders and files
inside:

```shell
kaishi
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ content
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 404.md
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ contact.md
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ features.md
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ offline.md
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ privacy.md
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ terms.md
â””â”€â”€ template
    â”œâ”€â”€ contact.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.js
    â”œâ”€â”€ page.html
    â””â”€â”€ sw.js

3 directories, 13 files
```

The content and presentation are separate, so you can change the site's look and
feel without changing its content. The `content` directory stores Markdown files,
while the `template` directory holds HTML and Javascript files. This template
should be used as a starting point for your website and can be modified to suit
your needs.

#### Change to the project directory

```shell
cd mysite
```

### 3. Generate the new site

```shell
ssg  -n=docs -c=content -t=template -o=output -s=public
```

The `ssg` command will generate a new site in the `docs` directory using the
content from the `content` directory and the template from the `template`
directory. The generated site will be stored in the `docs` directory. The
`public` and the `output` directories are used during the build process and can
be safely ignored. The `ssg` command will also start a local web server on port
`8000` to serve the generated site.

You can now look at the generated site by opening the following url in your
browser:

<http://127.0.0.1:8000/>

### 4. Deploy the site (optional)

You can deploy the site to your server by copying the `docs` directory to your
server. You can also use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
For example, you can use [GitHub Pages â§‰][05] to host your site for free.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first website with Shokunin.
